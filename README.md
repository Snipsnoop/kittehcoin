Modified random reward system with a guaranteed minimum reward of 1,000 MEOW per block and a 0.000005% chance of mining a 'jackpot reward'. A 'jackpot reward' rewards the miner with a multiple of the amount of MEOW that was to be awarded in that target block range. The chance of mining a 'jackpot block' is a flat 1 in 20,000 (0.00005%).

For example, if you mine a 'jackpot block' for block 50,000 and your reward was to be 78,235 you will receive 782,350 MEOW.

The 'jackpot reward' system was put in place to ensure that everyone, not just the super-early-adopters, stand a chance of receiving a large payout, whether solo mining or mining at a pool.
